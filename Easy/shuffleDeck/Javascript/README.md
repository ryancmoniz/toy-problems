Given an array containing a deck of cards, implement a function that shuffles
the deck.

**Note**:
  A shuffled deck should be completely random. That means that a given card should
  be as likely as any other to appear in a given deck index, completely independent
  of the order of the input deck. Think carefully about how to be sure your algorithm
  generates a properly shuffled deck-- it is easy to accidentally create a biased algorithm.
 
Example:

Input

    var deck = orderedDeck();
    ["A♥","2♥","3♥",...,"J♦","Q♦","K♦"]

 
 Output    

    shuffleDeck(deck);
    ["2♠","J♣","A♦", ... ,"7♣","8♣","K♠"]
